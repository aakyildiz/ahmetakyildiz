            <p>
                Hey! I'm a frontend developer at Mimosa Networks, where I spend most of my time 
                working on our network management platform — currently in the middle of migrating 
                it from Angular to React. Before moving into development, I spent about six years 
                in QA and eventually led our Turkey team.
            </p>
            <p>
                The QA background turned out to be pretty useful — there's something about breaking 
                things professionally that makes you better at building them. These days I'm most 
                comfortable in React and TypeScript, though I'll happily pick up whatever gets the 
                job done. Finished my Master's recently, focusing on NLP and automated testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me training for my next triathlon, hunting 
                for good specialty coffee, or reading about medieval history. Also into skiing and 
                kitesurfing when the weather cooperates.
